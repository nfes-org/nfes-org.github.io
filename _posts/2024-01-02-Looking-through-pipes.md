The presentation **“Looking through pipes, how do we use CT scans in the Oil and Gas industry?”** will be given by **Olivier Lopez, from Equinor**.

 

 
## Abstract 

The utilization of Computerized Tomography (CT) has become widespread in the oil and gas industry, serving various purposes such as imaging multiphase core flooding experiments to rock characterization. Notably, recent advancements in CT scanner technology have significantly reduced acquisition times while enhancing image quality. This progress has enabled the scanning of entire cored intervals within a remarkably short timeframe, often spanning mere hours.

CT scans conducted at two different energy levels (Dual-Energy CT or DECT) allow the direct derivation of crucial core properties, including bulk density (RHOB), mean atomic number (Zeff), and photoelectric factor (PEF). This presentation will delve into the integration of CT images and data into log evaluation software, unveiling the myriad benefits ranging from optimal seal peels selection to refined core descriptions and enhanced facies identification.

Beyond its application in core analysis, CT imaging has found utility in diverse domains within the oil and gas sector. This talk will showcase the expanding landscape of CT usage, highlighting specific instances where it has proven invaluable. From seal peels to core descriptions and facies identification, the integration of CT technology into the industry's analytical framework promises to improve our understanding and tackle to various challenges.

## Biography

**Olivier Lopez** began his career as an engineer specialized in flow in porous media and was consultant for a number of oil & gas companies worldwide in Numerical Rocks (Norway). He then joined Statoil in 2012 as a reservoir technology researcher. Since 2015, he is part of research team on Petrophysics and most of his work is dedicated to core and borehole imaging. He is currently working as a leading researcher in Sedimentology, Stratigraphy and Petrophysics within Equinor where he developed numerous workflows to integrate all type of images for better reservoir characterization and formation evaluation. He holds a Ph.D in fundamental and applied geochemistry and a master’s degree in chemical engineering.
