Abstract
</h4>



      
<p>
Consideration of the distinction between rocks and

      minerals is of vital importance in the petrophysical

      task of determining porosity and hence, water

      saturation. Given the significance of this task it is

      surprising how much confusion there is across the

      industry over this issue. The confusion between

      clay and shale is the most common, to the extent

      that many books, papers, training courses and

      software products still do not differentiate, or

      explain these clearly or correctly.
</p>



      
<p>


      Shale is a rock, typically defined as an indurated,

      finely laminated, sedimentary rock, composed

      primarily of clay, mud and silt. The important

      feature to note is that this definition does not

      describe the mineralogy but rather the grain size.

      In this definition, clay refers to clay sized

      particles, i.e. < 1/256 mm.
</p>



    
<p>


Whilst clay can refer to grain size it can also refer 

to clay minerals, and it is the dual meaning of the 

word clay that is at the heart of the confusion in 

the industry. Clay minerals are a group of hydrous 

aluminium silicates with a sheet-like structure 

(phyllosilicates), which adsorb water on their 

surfaces. It is these clay minerals that we are 

concerned about when determining porosity and 

water saturation.
</p>



    
<p>


In shale, most of the clay sized particles are 

composed of clay minerals. When computing 

porosity we need to account for the clay minerals, 

for example when their density is different from 

the matrix density. When computing water 

saturation we need to account for the excess 

conductivity due to the clay minerals. In both 

cases it is the volume of clay minerals we need to 

correct for, not the volume of shale.
</p>



    
<p>


Shale models are technically correct when they 

include a relationship between volume of shale 

and either volume of clay or volume of silt.
</p>



    
<p>


It is very important not to confuse clay and shale 

models as this simple error can lead to many 

problems: misunderstanding the difference 

between effective porosity and total porosity; the 

erroneous use of structural, laminated and 

dispersed clay models when really it is a change in 

the clay content of the shale; treating silt as a 

mineral when it is a grain size; shale computed 

with zero porosity; other low quality reservoir 

layers, such as siltstones, computed with zero 

porosity leading to them being modelled as zero 

permeability baffles, when in reality they can store 

hydrocarbons and be considered reservoir when 

they are high enough above the free water level.

This paper seeks to lift the fog of confusion.
