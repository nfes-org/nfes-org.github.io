## Abstract
Frigg Gamma Delta is the largest field in the Yggdrasil development project with Aker BP as the operator and PGNiG as partner. A considerable top reservoir uncertainty is present due to the unclear seismic response, particularly over the Gamma structure. The field is also impacted by the past gas production from the main Frigg field in the west, which has led to contact movements in other Frigg structures. 

Recently, Aker BP drilled an observation well with 1 vertical and 4 horizontal branches, with the main objective to map the top of the structure, define the current fluid contacts and determine the outline of the HC accumulation. In order to do that, DAR/UDAR tools were deployed as main geosteering drivers, together with the classic formation evaluation measurements, resulting in improved understanding of the most important features of the reservoir.

This presentation will show how the results of the four horizontal well branches drilled on the Gamma structure have resulted in an improved top reservoir depth map and improved understanding of the current contacts across the structure. The well has added value to the project by identification of a smaller gas cap and increased oil volumes, but more importantly, by being able to optimize the drainage pattern and avoid the drilling of potentially negative production wells.
