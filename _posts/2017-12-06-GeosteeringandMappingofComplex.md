<p>
A paper presented at SPE ATCE in San Antonio in 2017.

<p>
Most production wells currently drilled in the North Sea are in complex geological settings. In order to place the wells safely and effectively, drilling a successful production well requires an advanced technology and integrated proactive reservoir navigation approach, in addition to multiple data driven answer products from downhole tools.

</p>

<p>
Extra deep azimuthal resistivity logging while drilling (LWD) tools can detect boundaries up to 30 m away from the wellbore given optimal resistivity conditions. Combined with multicomponent inversion modelling (MCWD), the data acquired are used to map multiple boundaries, individual sand bodies, reservoir thicknesses, and lateral reservoir changes.

</p>

<p>
Borehole images aid in geosteering and are used to steer up or down based on structural boundaries identified on the image. Using wired pipe technology that provides telemetry rates good enough for memory-resolution data, the full resolution electrical image is available while drilling.

</p>

<p>
Despite complex reservoir geometry in both external boundaries and internal sedimentary structure, it was possible to successfully geosteer by using an integrated geosteering approach. Through MCWD inversion, it was possible to track a thin, highly resistive layer at the roof for much of the reservoir, which allowed for proactive geosteering, optimizing wellbore placement and mapping of reservoir volumes.

<p>
In 2011 he sought new challenges and further career development and started working onshore as a RNS supervisor. In 2014 Nils-Birger took on the role as manager for the RNS geosteering service in Norway. Nils Birger holds a Msc. Degree in Marine Geology from the University of Bergen from 2005.
