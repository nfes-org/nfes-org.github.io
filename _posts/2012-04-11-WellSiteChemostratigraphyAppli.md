Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Well-site chemostratigraphy is a versatile tool aiding in real-time decision making while drilling. The technique employs the inorganic, chemical composition (20-45 elements) of rock samples/cuttings for formation evaluation. It finds its applications in near-real time well-to-well correlation, casing, coring and TD point determination, fault and offset identification, as well as geosteering.  Geochemical data also can be modelled into lithology, mineralogy and reservoir/rock properties. As a surface service, it is independent from down-hole environments, such as high pressure/high temperature conditions, and can be utilized for slim-hole and/or under-balanced drilling.

<p>
Following Christian's doctorate research on chemostratigraphy and provenance identification from whole-rock and mineral geochemistry, he continued to work with chemostratigraphy at iReS Ltd. and Chemostrat Ltd. As part of the Chemostrat / Halliburton alliance, Christian applied chemostratigraphy at the well-site while drilling. In 2006, he joined the Halliburton LaserStrat team and became responsible for chemostratigraphy well-site projects in the North Sea and the Middle East. Since early 2011 Christian is fulfilling the position of a senior technical advisor for geochemical solutions with emphasis on the eastern hemisphere.
