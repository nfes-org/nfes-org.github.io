## Abstract
Since years the subhorizontal well (SHW) concept has been advocated as a means for reclaiming heat from low permeability geothermal reservoirs which would otherwise remain unchallenged (Ungemach et al, 2011; Ungemach et al, 2016).

The concept was validated in spring 2018 on a Geothermal District Heating (GDH) site, located at Cachan, South of Paris, in a low to medium permeability, multi-layered reservoir environment. It succeeded in replacing, via a single SHW doublet rated at a 450 (nominal)/500 m3/h (maximum) productive/injective capacity, two existing doublets, aged 34 years, limited to a 350 m3/h (maximum) yield, thus pioneering a world premiere in geothermal well design (Thinkgeoenergy, 2018).

The present paper, further to a description of the SHW architecture and accompanying geosteering drilling/navigation technology, focus on wireline logging, well testing and geochemical monitoring attributes of the reservoir assessment strategy.
## Biography
Miklos Antics is Managing Director and associate partner of both GPC Instrumentation Process (GPC IP) and GEOFLUID France. He is being active during the past 30 years in project development from low to high enthalpy fields in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands, England, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya (African Rift countries), El Salvador, Armenia, and Indonesia. Developed sustainable reservoir concepts for many geothermal fields by coordinating geoscientific, reservoir engineering and drilling/completion of geothermal projects. Developed innovative well architectures to maximise heat extraction in a sustainable view. He lectured on Geothermal Reservoir Simulation and Sustainable development of geothermal resources at CAS-DGEOSYS (University of Neuch√¢tel), several ISS (International Summer School) and seminars. Authored and co-authored over 60 technical papers (English and Romanian) and four textbooks. He holds MSc and PhD in Petroleum Engineering from the Ploiesti (Romania) School of Petrol. He also holds a Diploma in Geothermal Energy Technology from Geothermal Institute in New Zealand. He is President of the European Geothermal Council (EGEC) since 2018. Member of IGA, EGEC, EAGE, GRC, SPE.
