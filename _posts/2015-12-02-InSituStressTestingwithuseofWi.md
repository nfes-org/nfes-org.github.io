Abstract
</h4>



      
<p>
The presentation provides an overview of the new developments in in-situ stress testing methods and tools which are designed to help to overcome many of the common limitations of this technology.
</p>

<p>


In-Situ stress measurements are an essential input to a wide range of geomechanics applications in field exploration, development and production.
</p>

<p>


An unfavorable distribution of the stress in the rock, like a large difference between the vertical and horizontal stress, may cause a wellbore to be mechanically unstable. Precise knowledge of the stress profile is an important input to well and completion design. The ability to control well stability and sand management also depend on largely on the understanding of the stress distribution. In order to design the hydraulic fracture stimulation, the state of stress in the reservoir, and in the barrier layers above and below must be known to contain the hydraulic fracture and prevent communication with other zones. Production and injection (water injection, pressure support, EOR etc) may change the local stress condition which can lead to changes in permeability or even activate faults and thus affect production performance.

Vladislav Achourov is a Principal Reservoir Domain Champion with Schlumberger, since the end of 2007 based in Norway. He has received Master's Degree in Physics from Russian University of Oil & Gas and joined Schlumberger in Russia in 2000 as a reservoir engineer. Vlad has worked with reservoir simulations and production log interpretation and in his current role provides technical support for all the wireline formation testing services in Scandinavia.
