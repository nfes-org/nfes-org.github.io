## About the event

Due to the high cost of offshore operations in a harsh environment, 
the North Sea is in the top league in developing cutting-edge technologies for formation evaluation and geosteering. 
Many innovative solutions pioneered for the North Sea are now commercially available worldwide. 
Extensive research, technology development, and investments in innovation remain the key factors that provide more value for each well delivered in the region, keeping it competitive worldwide. 
With the increased focus on the green shift, the traditional hydrocarbon projects are joined by wells, which enable the energy industry in a broader sense.
Motivated by the workshop's success in 2019, NFES and NORCE invite you again to the Oil Capital of Norway (Stavanger) to meet other geosteering experts and share the ideas that would drive the energy industry forward in the following decades.
