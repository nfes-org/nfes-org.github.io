The presentation **”Barrier Verification via Acoustic Leak Off Test - Rigless P&A”** will be given by **Remke Ellis, from TGT.**

## Abstract:

Barrier integrity for P&A can be verified using several different tools and methods. A direct way to verify a barrier is to conduct a pressure test. These tests are time consuming for conclusive barrier verification, and there are multiple causes for failure. This presentation focuses on use of Spectral Acoustics in conjunction with pressure test to rapidly verify the integrity of annular barriers (cement/formation) and identity the reason(s) of failure. This method does not require pulling of tubing and can be carried out Rigless.
