<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



<p>
A recently launched Logging- While-Drilling (LWD) ultrasonic imaging tool now enables operators to obtain high-resolution structural, stratigraphic, and borehole geometry information in both water and oil-based muds by means of acoustic impedance contrast and ultrasonic amplitude measurements. Results from the very first  deployment of this new imager in Europe will be presented.
