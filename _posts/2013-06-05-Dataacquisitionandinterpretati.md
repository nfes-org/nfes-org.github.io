Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
The Deep Directional Electromagnetic LWD tool has been under field test for the last few years in the North Sea and elsewhere.  In this presentation we will show introduce the tool, the multilayer inversion processing, and show an array of different field applications of this new service to date.
</p>

<p>
The real-time inversion is automatic, runs continuously and does not require user inputs such as shoulder resistivity or expected number of layers.  The field tests reviewed show that the service brings value in landing, reservoir delineation and geosteering applications.
