The presentation **”An Operators Perspective on the Future of Geosteering and Well Placement  Solutions”** will be given by **Monica Vik Constable**, Equinor.


Due the increased COVID-19, the last NFES technical meeting for 2020 will be run digitally only.
 
### Abstract:

Sand injectites on the Norwegian Continental Shelf have proven their commercial significance. Some are already producing e.g. Volund, Viper, Balder, Ringhorne and Kobra fields, while others like in production licenses (PL) 340 and 869 have recently been discovered and appraised. Extensive literature on the geology of sand injectites have been published (e.g. Jenssen et al. 1993; Jolly et al. 2002; Huuse et al. 2003; Hurst et al. 2005). However, few references are available on the petrophysical and geophysical aspects of sand injectite reservoirs. In this paper, the petrophysical properties of sand injectite facies; dykes, sills and brecciated sands are discussed, along-with their identification from seismic data. A perception that volumetrics of sand injectite reservoirs cannot be reliably evaluated is assessed.

Innovative interpretation methods for mapping structure, fluids and reservoir properties around horizontal wells while drilling are critical for future success on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).  In order to optimize geosteering and well placement solutions from 3D mapping and characterization in real-time, the challenge is to establish more efficient workflows for integrating geological knowledge with standard logs, ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity and seismic through new digital solutions. Key benefits of the integrated workflows will be demonstrated with some examples from NCS well placement operations.

### Biography:

**Monica Vik Constable** started working in the oil industry in 1997 as a wireline field engineer for Schlumberger. She joined Statoil in 2005 as a Petrophysicist and was a Leading Advisor in Petrophysics in Statoil from 2009 – 2014. She is currently working in Equinor research as a manager for the Subsurface Illumination project, focusing on a portfolio of technologies aiming at an ambitious 3D visualization of the subsurface while drilling, and deliver automated high-resolution 3D-models in real time for optimal well placement, drilling optimization, improved reservoir management and geohazard avoidance. Monica was distinguished speaker of the SPWLA on the matter with her engagement in “looking ahead of the bit while drilling: from vision to reality” and she has been overseeing the implementation of look ahead and look around resistivity measurements in Equinor.
