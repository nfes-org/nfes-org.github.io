Abstract
</h4>





<p>
Review of the acoustic dipole imaging technique followed by a case history of a North Sea gas well logged through-casing with XMAC to define near wellbore fractures.

</p>

<p>


A North Sea well was drilled through a thick evaporite sequence. During drilling, gas shows were

observed in the halite section by the mudloggers. No openhole wireline logs were acquired over the interval of interest; however, a full-wave monopole and dipole acoustic log was acquired over the interval of interest after casing had been set. The acoustic imaging processing detected geologic reflector structures through the casing up to 70 feet from the borehole. 
</p>

<p>


Two types of reflectors with different dip angles were mapped out by the imaging. The low dip-angle reflectors are assigned to the formation beds/structures crossing the borehole. High-angle reflectors correspond to fractures and/or faults of large extent in the formation. These acoustic imaging results were then compared to the gas shows observed during drilling and showed a direct correlation to the high-angle reflectors. This technique made it possible to estimate the fracture presence away from the borehole and pathways for gas migration into the borehole.
