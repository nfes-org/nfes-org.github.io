Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
This lunch and learn will aim to provide a practical refresher on NMR interpretation, starting with understanding your ‘field print’.  Followed by a brief explanation of NMR porosity, permeability models and ‘relaxation’.  Before spending time explaining the differing types of NMR spectra, and how knowing what type of spectra you are viewing will aid your interpretation. Finally 2D NMR will be discussed.
