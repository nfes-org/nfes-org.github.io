<h4>
Abstract
</h4>





<p>
This new approach uses the attenuation of the casing and tool collar signal along an array of receivers from an LWD sonic tool, to extend the quantitative cement evaluation to the full range of bond index in all types of casing and cements. (Reference SPE-170886-MS, Vivian Pistre et al.)

<p>
Marcelo graduated with a degree in Physics from the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Mexico in 1995. He started his oilfield career with Schlumberger Geco-Prakla in 1996 as field geophysicist in Mexico. Since then he has held various operational positions around the globe, including senior seismologist, general field engineer in logging and directional drilling and as a senior drilling engineer. Marcelo then taught as a drilling and measurement instructor in Schlumberger training centers before he moved in 2010 into his current role as advising Acoustic Domain Champion, supporting different areas in South America, Central Europe and the North Sea.
