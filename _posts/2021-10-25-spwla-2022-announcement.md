We are excited to host all our members and friends of [SPWLA in Scandinavia June 10th – 15th 2022](https://www.spwlaworld.org/), bringing our global technical community close together in the friendly Norwegian energy capital. Very much needed after these recent challenging years!

Norway and Stavanger is home to numerous national and international operators and service companies, leading academia and research institutes as well the National Petroleum Directorate.
Norway’s geology and landscape, and its cultural history of the area give great opportunities for field trips and experiences for a lifetime. The long summer days in June allow for great social events and sport activities until late evening.

[Stavanger](https://www.regionstavanger-ryfylke.com/), a world’s known energy hub, being a center for trade, shipping and business has great connection through its international airport to the world. With this easy and short access all is in place for a successful and rewarding symposium.
[Clarion Hotel Energy](https://www.nordicchoicehotels.com/hotels/norway/stavanger/clarion-hotel-energy/) will be the main venue for SPWLA 2022. The hotel is within short distance of Downtown Stavanger where you find numerous restaurants, shops, museums and activities that will make SPWLA 2022 a memorable event.
