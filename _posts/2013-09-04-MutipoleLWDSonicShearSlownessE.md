Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
LWD technology has progressed rapidly in recent years to address the need for saving rig time, making real-time decisions for drilling efficiency and risk managements, and accurate geosteering. Real-time LWD sonic measurements provide timely analysis for borehole stability problems, drilling optimization, and assisting with pore-pressure prediction and seismic well ties. The sonic measurement can provide data to accurately determine well placement on the seismic sections and can create direct ties between downhole and seismic measurements. Quadrupole acoustic logging is used to measure shear in the logging-while-drilling (LWD) environment. Evaluation of shear slowness in quadrupole acoustic logging requires an inversion method that takes into account the dispersion of the quadrupole mode, including tool-presence effects. The presentation will describe the basics of LWD sonic logging, quadrupole inversion methodology and various examples.

Michiko Hamada is currently a petrophysics domain champion in Stavanger. She joined Schlumberger in 2003 as a field engineer in the United States, held petrophysicist position in multiple locations in USA mainly evaluating SonicScanner and RST response in Diatomite formation. She was then assigned to the Schlumberger Kabushiki Kaisha acoustic engineering center in Japan, overseeing worldwide LWD acoustic operation/interpretation along with the new generation in sonic development.  She has a BS degree in pure mathematics from Hirosaki University, and MSc in pure mathematics from Tohoku University.
