## Abstract:
Geosteering of wells requires fast petrophysical and geological interpretation of logs, often forming non-unique inverse problems. We developed a multi-modal probabilistic interpretation method using a single evaluation of an artificial deep neural network (DNN) in milliseconds. A mixture density DNN is trained using the “multiple-trajectory-prediction” loss functions. It outputs several stratigraphic solutions and their probabilities and predictions of stratigraphy ahead of data. Thus, it yields an AI that learns the ability to match the logs and select likely geological scenarios from the training data.
The proposed approach is verified on a stratigraphic interpretation of gamma-ray and rate-of-penetration logs from drilling in an unconventional field. For a single chunk of data, the multi-modal predictor outputs several viable inverse solutions/predictions, providing more accurate and realistic solutions than a deterministic regression using a DNN. Applying this method sequentially (using the precious interpretations as starting points) allows tracking several likely stratigraphic realizations throughout a geosteering operation or until new data disconfirm them. Multi-solution tracking is vital for drilling operations where only a little, noisy, or low-quality data is available. It enables informed decisions from quantified geological uncertainties.
