Abstract
</h4>



            
<p>


A vision in the oil industry for decades is

becoming a reality - we can now finally drill and

react pro-actively to formation resistivity

properties identified several meters ahead of the

drill-bit, instead of drilling reactively on resistivity

measurements at or behind the bit. Through a

technology collaboration with Schlumberger,

Statoil supported a targeted technology

development for measuring resistivity contrasts

ahead of the bit in real-time to reduce cost and risk

during drilling operations.
</p>

<p>


Two Electro-Magnetic Look Ahead (EMLA)

prototypes have been developed for 12.25” to 14”

borehole diameter. The EMLA tool is modular and

consists of a low frequency EM-transmitter

inserted in the rotary steerable drilling tool about

1.8 m behind the bit. The transmitter induces

currents at multiple frequencies around and ahead

of the bit and the resulting induced magnetic field

is recorded with 2 to 3 receivers spaced out in the

drillstring. The formation structure ahead of the hit

is interpreted by inversion of the bulk signals to

differentiate sensitivity around the tool from

effects ahead of the bit. The look ahead capability

of the EMLA tool is dependent on the transmitter

receiver spacings, frequencies, resistivity around

the tool, thickness of the target, and the resistivity

contrast ahead of the bit.
</p>

<p>


The EMLA tool provides a step change with

regards to the precision we now can detect

changes in rock properties ahead of bit, enabling

the well placement teams to “see” several meters

ahead of the bit and to react before drilling into

potential hazardous situations, even in near

vertical wells. One key use of the EMLA

technology on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is

to drill and set casing for the 12.25” section much

closer to top reservoir than we do today. This can

reduce the risk of collapse in the overburden,

especially for depleted reservoirs which require a

significantly lower mud weight for drilling the

reservoir than the optimal weight for stabilizing

the overburden. The technology can also be used

to pick the coring point more precisely and prior to

drilling into the zone of interest This will enable

coring of the transition between overburden and

reservoir which is often missed when using near

bit measurements and also prevent costly coring of

thin sand stringers mistaken as the main zone of

interest.
</p>

<p>


Statoil has recently tested the tool in a sub salt

play in the Gulf of Mexico with great success. One

of the main objectives was to detect bottom salt

before drilling through it. The highly resistive salt

formation offers a very favorable environment for

EM applications. The bottom salt was detected 30

m ahead of bit, which gave the drillers an early

warning of the salt exit and potential drilling

challenges.
</p>

<p>


In the near future, with the technology already

there, simultaneous look around and look ahead

(LALA) while drilling will be available.

Interpretation of measurements in 2D and 3D

environment is the main challenge to overcome to

make LALA happen. To do so, a tight

integration between inversions and geological

scenarios will be a necessity.
