## Abstract
The Breidablikk field on the NCS, interpreted as an injectite reservoir is characterized by a high degree of structural complexity of both top and base of the main reservoir sand body. Above the main reservoir a complex network of thinner injectite sand bodies covering the range from seismic to centimeter scale is seen. The asset would like to place the production wells as close to the top reservoir as possible while still minimizing their exposure to potentially unstable roof shale. The asset team asked in-house UDAR expertise, if this technology could be used to solve two objectives: 1) Use UDAR to map reservoir heterogeneities from a pilot well up to the top reservoir boundary before drilling the producer, and 2) to map the distance to the OWC. 

This presentation will show how having access to a high-resolution realistic 3D reservoir model and service provider UDAR inversion capabilities were key tools for well planning and geosteering strategy development. The UDAR modeling helped to; 1) increase inhouse understanding of UDAR inversion sensitivity and resolution issues, 2) better prepare for upcoming geosteering jobs, 3) to help in interpretation support for post drill evaluations. 

1D and 2D UDAR inversion data can be very complex to interpret due to uncertainties related to the sensitivity range and inversion artefacts frequently seen in geologically complex areas. The presentation will discuss and show examples on how inversion artefacts and sensitivity ranges both in 1D and 2D can be better understood through synthetic modelling on realistic high-resolution 3D models. This knowledge is now used in the ongoing drilling campaign to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, both in real-time and in cases where well planning is based on pilot data.


## Biography
Kåre Røsvik Jensen holds a Cand. Scient. in geology and have worked within the oil industry since 2001. Since 2006 the focus has been on planning and execution of geosteering jobs. For the last 11 years he has been an employed by Equinor, where he is currently focusing on geosteering related questions within Equinor’s Technology, Development, and Innovation Business Area in Bergen. 

Berit Ensted Danielsen is a principal geophysicist within Equinor’s Technology, Development and Innovation Business Area in Stavanger, Norway. Her work focusses on pre- and post-job evaluation of high angle wells using ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity measurements. She has previously worked for 8 years with Controlled Source EM for exploration and has more than 20 years of experience with modelling and inversion of electromagnetic data. Berit holds a Ph.D. in Engineering Geology from Lund University, Sweden.
