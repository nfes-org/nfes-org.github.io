## Abstract
Deep and ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity measurements have become important technologies in geosteering and reservoir mapping applications for the energy industry. Initiated in June 2016, Standardization of LWD Deep Azimuthal Resistivity (SDAR) workgroup was formed under the SPWLA resistivity special interest group (Rt SIG). The SDAR workgroup is an industrial advisory committee, which is composed of technical experts and representatives from oil companies, oilfield service companies, and academic institutions. The purpose of the SDAR workgroup is to promote deep and ultra-deep azimuthal resistivity technologies, understand the details of the tools and interpretation workflows provided by different vendors, and provide training and education opportunities to the industry. Committee meetings have been organized frequently to cover all the technical topics, including key tool parameters, benchmark models, forward modeling and inversions, measurement uncertainties, final deliverables, presentation formats, pre-drill studies, real-time operation, post-processing, etc. Several technical documents have been produced and published on the SDAR website, and the SDAR group arranged a UDAR workshop during the last SPWLA annual symposium in Stavanger. In this talk, we would like to briefly introduce the workgroup to the Norwegian Formation Evaluation Society and give an update on the current progress.
## Biography
Frank Antonsen is a specialist in petrophysics within Equinorâ€™s Technology, Development, and Innovation Business Area in Trondheim, Norway. He has more than 20 years of experience from the oil industry with focus on R&D activities within petrophysics and UDAR since 2008 (tool development projects with service providers and UDAR interpretation). Currently he is part of an Optimal Well Placement project in Equinor with the ambition to update high resolution 3D-models in real-time for optimal well placement based on integrated workflows including UDAR.
