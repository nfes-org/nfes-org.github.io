</h4>



            
<p>


        During drilling, the acquisition of gas in mud data is an almost universal practice used for geological surveillance and safety. This source of data is, however, rarely used for formation evaluation because of the widely accepted presumption that it is unreliable and unrepresentative of the formation fluids. Therefore, recent developments in the mud-logging industry aimed to improve gas data acquisition and analysis and have led to the availability of better quality data. The comparison of surface gas, PVT, and geochemistry data clearly confirms the consistency between the drilling gas data (gas shows) and the corresponding reservoir fluid composition.

        This NFES Lecture will be focusing on the impact of recent improvements in gas-acquisition technology and the new GWD methodology. In fact, these improvements enabled us to perform reservoir interpretation in near real time allowing fluid and contacts identification, fluid modeling processing and uncertainty evaluation and consequently allowing Geosteering application and operational optimization (e.g., coring, wireline recording and sampling, and testing operations).

        These improvements make it is also possible to integrate the GWD interpretation in reservoir, geochemical, PVT analysis, and comprehensive studies.
