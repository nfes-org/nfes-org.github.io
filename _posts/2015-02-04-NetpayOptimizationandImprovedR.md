<h4>
Abstract
</h4>





<p>
Statoil has played a key role in testing and development of the new ultra-deep directional resistivity (DDR) logging while drilling (LWD) measurements for high angle and horizontal wells the last 4 years. Inverted resistivity images provide an overview of geological structures and fluid contacts tens of meters around the wellbore. The ultra-deep look around measurements, sensitive to resistivity contrasts up to 30 m away or even more in favorable conditions, are a step change, when it comes to possibility to position the wellbore strategically in the reservoir and to characterize reservoir structure and properties. 

</p>

<p>
This paper will present how the new DDR measurements have been applied with success in an operating license on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Long horizontal wells in the reservoir sections have been identified as a key strategy to increase recovery. The main benefits from the DDR measurements in the license have been to maximize reservoir exposure by active geosteering, to optimize well placement above oil-water contact, and to increase subsurface understanding which is important input for future well plans.

</p>

<p>
The DDR measurements are already a commercial service with regard to well placement and reservoir landing. Statoil is however also actively pushing for improved reservoir characterization, by coupling geomodels and DDR modeling and inversion software. This paper will also present how standard LWD logs and images can be combined with the DDR inversion results, to build a near-wellbore 3D structural model supporting all available data. This is an important step towards an extended use of the new data not only for well placement, but also for increased subsurface understanding and geomodel update.

<p>
Frank graduated from Norwegian University of Science and Technology with a civil engineering degree and PhD in biophysics. He joined Statoil in 1998 and started as a researcher in petrophysics with special focus on NMR core and log analysis. He worked as a petrophysicist in an operating asset offshore Mid-Norway between 2004 â€“ 2006. After this period he returned to the Statoil Research Centre in Trondheim and has since then worked with deep electromagnetic measurements on LWD and also with CSEM-methods. He was appointed as Specialist in petrophysics in Statoil in 2012.
