<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



      
<p>


This presentation will explain how it is possible to measure water pressure inside an oil reservoir with a hydrophilic probe, and how to use this pressure to estimate the distance to the oil/water contact.
</p>

<p>
 

The pressure difference between oil and water can also provide information about invasion of water into a reservoir segment long before anything can be seen on a saturation log. 
</p>

<p>


The presentation will also give some details on how the hydrophilic probe works, share fresh results from the lab and show the conceptual design of a wire-line tool capable of performing the measurement in an open hole discovery well.

Biography

<p>


        Trond Rolfsvåg, has a Master’s degree in Petroleum Technology from University of Stavanger. He has worked with IOR related research (NORCE), but most of the 30 year career as a reservoir engineer in Equinor (5 years) and ConocoPhillips (20 years). Mentoring less experienced RE’s, and monitoring R&D project has always been an important part of the various assignments.

        He has developed a technology for finding the oil/water contact without drilling through it in 2015. Left ConocoPhillips in 2016 and established Hydrophilic AS in 2016.
