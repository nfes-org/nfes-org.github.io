## Biography
Kelli Randall (BS/MS Geology, Louisiana State University) has over fifteen years of geosteering experience in three basins and seven plays in North America and now serves as the global geosteering subject matter expert at Chevron.  She worked Bakken and East Texas/North Louisiana assets at Marathon Oil in Houston, Texas before joining Atlas Energy and then Chevron in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Kelli has translated her broad range of geosteering expertise into practical tools, guidance, and training materials used by geosteering practitioners across Chevron’s global shale and tight asset class.  In addition to directing the vision and execution of geosteering-related digital projects, Kelli maintains Chevron’s internal geosteering community of practice.
