<p>


We will review formation evaluation methods focused on reducing the uncertainty of reservoir thickness and volumes of hydrocarbons-in-place.  Two case studies will describe the applications of NMR and dielectric dispersion logs to the evaluation of a heavy-oil reservoir under steam injection offshore West Africa, and of a bioclastic carbonate reservoir from a highly deviated drain offshore UK.
