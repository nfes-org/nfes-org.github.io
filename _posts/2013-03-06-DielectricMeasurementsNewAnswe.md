Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Conductivity measurements have been the backbone of Petrophysical Analysis for decades. But conductivity is only half the story. The electromagnetic properties of a formation are defined by two properties – conductivity and relative permittivity. Since the 1980s, when Dielectric tools were introduced, the search has been on to quantify this missing sibling of conductivity. And it is only now that dielectric measurements, bolstered by dispersion quantification have resurfaced to bring new answers to the table and also fill in the missing gaps in resistivity interpretation and the parameters that convert resistivity to saturation.

Amitabha Chatterjee has an engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Delhi obtained in 1993. He joined Schlumberger in the same year as a field engineer, working across the Middle East, Venezuela, US and India. He has worked in sales, operations, R&D and training before moving into Petrophysics. In 2010 he published his first novel – a work of fiction based on the oilfield. He is currently based in Stavanger, Norway as an Associate Domain Petrophysicist for Wireline.
