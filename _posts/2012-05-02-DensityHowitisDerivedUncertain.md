Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
In general the porosity in a reservoir rock is derived through the use of density measurements from chemical sources. From the accurate and repeatable measurement in the laboratory to fully understand the downhole environment and the influence on the derived porosity is a demanding task for the petrophysicist. All different porosity devices will read differently, although correct, in a downhole environment. The different factors contributing to the overall measurement will be highlighted and cases showing differences will be evaluated. The total uncertainty in the measurement and the influence on the resulting porosity measurement will be part of the final discussion.
