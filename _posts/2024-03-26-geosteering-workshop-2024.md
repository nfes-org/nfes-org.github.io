## About the event

**The 3rd Stavanger Geosteering Workshop Keeps its Local Focus and Global Perspective**.

Due to the high cost of offshore operations in a harsh environment, 
the North Sea is in the top league in developing cutting-edge technologies for formation evaluation and geosteering. 
Many innovative solutions pioneered for the North Sea are now commercially available worldwide. 
Extensive research, technology development, and investments in innovation remain the key factors that provide more value for each well delivered in the region, keeping it competitive worldwide. 
With the increased focus on the green shift, the traditional hydrocarbon projects are joined by wells, which enable the energy industry in a broader sense.
Our precious workshops in 2019 and 2022 each gathered almost 100 experts and got excellent feedback.
Motivated by the series' success, NFES and NORCE invite you again to the Oil Capital of Norway (Stavanger) to meet other geosteering experts and share ideas to drive the energy industry forward in the following decades.

## Program

[**Full program**](/2024/09/17/workshop-2024-schedule.html) is now available but several presentations are still pending confirmation.

The program includes:

* Plenary technical presentations
* Sponsor exhibition
