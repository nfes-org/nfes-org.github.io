The presentation **"Using the ‘entire’ acoustic waveform to quantify formation properties beyond just velocity”** will be given by **Philip Tracadas**, from **Halliburton**.


## Abstract
This talk presents how several different advanced signal processing algorithms can extract
more information than just velocity from sonic waveform ‘trace’ recordings. Most modern acoustic
logging tools record a sonic waveform ‘trace’ of vibrations versus time lasting 5 to 10s of milliseconds per
receiver station, much longer than it takes for the arrival time of refracted modes. Petrophysicists recall
the primary information extracted from these traces is inference of elastic properties by measurement of
velocity (or its inverse, slowness) of various acoustic modes that travel through the formation rock.

This paper focuses on using various interface modes to assess fracture fluid conductivity and two types
of formation anisotropy. Interface modes originate due to the borehole fluid and formation rock
interface, and exhibit frequency vs. slowness dispersion; that is, their slowness (or 1/velocity) is different
depending on frequency during the same trace recording. Using wide bandwidth and high dynamic
range trace recordings, along with differential phase processing, the measurement of dispersion can be
made over several to more than ten kilohertz. When analyzed in the correct frequency bands, dipole-
created flexural interface mode can be interpretated for azimuthal (TIH aka HTI) anisotropy mechanism
and polar (TIV aka VTI) anisotropy. Examples of continuous mechanism logs are presented. Low
frequency monopole-created Stoneley interface mode is also sensitive to polar anisotropy and a flexural-
Stoneley joint inversion process in the frequency domain is presented for Thomsen gamma
measurement.

The Stoneley interface mode is also the highest amplitude mode that can be excited. It exerts large
pressure changes on the borehole wall interface as it propagates, thus making it ideal as a mini-pressure
test of fluid conductive fractures (as investigated by Hornby et.al. 1989). The theory and algorithm to
estimate fracture conductivity are presented, which includes frequency spectral analysis of ‘reflections’
recorded later in the waveform trace after the direct Stoneley arrival.
 
## Biography
**Philip Tracadas** is a geoscientist subject matter expert for
borehole acoustics at Halliburton. From 2013-2016 he served as Associate Editor
for Acoustics for the SPWLA’s Petrophysics journal. Over the last decade, he has
taught internal acoustic training, for wireline and while drilling tools, from basic
to advanced products. With eighteen years of industry experience on various
acoustic processing algorithms and tools, he liaises between log analysts,
software developers, field operations, and customers to address formation
challenges with effective and efficient tools.
