<h4>
Abstract
</h4>





<p>
Baker Hughes has utilized Omni-directional extra deep resistivity technology for more than a decade in Norway, supporting real-time wellbore placement through Reservoir Navigation Services.  Maturity of many fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf are leading to more challenging wells to ensure enhanced oil recovery and extended production.  The challenge leads to a need for improved reservoir understanding in complex heterogeneous reservoirs, which in turn has led to the development of new extra-deep azimuthal resistivity technology.  To further enhance the downhole technology, inversion software has been developed to fully take advantage of the acquired data which are detecting bed boundaries up to 30m away from the borehole in any direction.

<p>
The presentation will take you through the technology overview, the inversion service and a field case from the Troll field where the technology is utilized. The presentation include the use of the data in real-time and 3D real-time visualization to improve the understanding of the reservoir geometry and fluid levels.

David Selvåg Larsen, CV
</h4>





<p>
David was born and raised in Stavanger where he was early introduced with the oil business.  After high school David moved to Tromsø to become an engineer.  Unfortunately, mechanical engineering was too much hard work and he therefore changed to Geology which he also realized was a lot of hard work and he therefore ended up with a master degree in marine geophysics. He got his first permanent employment in Baker Hughes in 2010, then working in the BEACON Geoscience.  After being trained and exposed to reservoir navigation he moved into his current position as a Reservoir Navigation Service Supervisor.  The last two years he has been leading the introduction of the new Extra Deep Azimuthal Resistivity service to Norway and has also been involved with EDAR deployments in Brazil, UK, Norway and Australia.
