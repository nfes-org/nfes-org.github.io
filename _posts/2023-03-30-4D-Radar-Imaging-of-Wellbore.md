## Abstract 

Wellbore shape and size is one of the key wellbore construction parameters, and which affects the well construction process, and subsequently calculations and decisions. Despite the importance of effectively understanding the wellbore shape and size, both for increased operational performance and for wellbore integrity/safety reasons, there has not been any viable technology available to the oil and gas industry to effectively determine wellbore shape and size for the large hole sizes while drilling.

 An electromagnetic Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tool which can measure borehole shape and size in large hole sizes (>12-1/4’’ hole size) is presented. The utilization of electromagnetic measurements enables Oil & Gas operators to obtain borehole shape and size measurements in large hole sizes where acoustic technologies have not been able to obtain echoes from the wellbore walls to derive borehole shape and size. The electromagnetic LWD tool enables the Oil & Gas operators to increase subsurface understanding, make more accurate calculations and sound decisions related to wellbore shape and size.

 The possibility to obtain wellbore shape and size measurements while drilling, and the later comparison of same depth intervals while pulling out, or otherwise re-logging drilled depth intervals, enables the Oil & Gas operator to evaluate the time-lapse of the measurements, to understand the development of wellbore shape and size as a function of time, which is a key, especially to subsequent operations, such as, but not limited to, successfully running casing and liners.
