Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Many mature fields nowadays are reaching the end of life. With current cost challenges in the North Sea Oil and Gas industry, there is an increased need for a –not only- safe and optimum well abandonment design but cost efficient too.
</p>

<p>
 

After more than 20 years of oil production in Draugen, we have recently abandoned a well for the first time in the field. During planning, a re-evaluation of the 1992 CBL (Cement Bond Log) was performed with a refined approach.  This methodology was validated and complemented with new generation sonic and ultrasonic data as part of the Abandonment operations: cement bond and creeping shale bond was observed and tested; it all served as basis for design and as input for the Draugen Abandonment Philosophy.
