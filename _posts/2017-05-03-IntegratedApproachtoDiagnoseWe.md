Abstract
</h4>



      
<p>
A North Sea well completed with sand screens and inflow control devices had been cleaned up and placed on production. However, its subsequent production had fallen short of expectations and displayed anomalous behaviour. The operator suspected that the cause of the well productivity problems might be plugging of the sand screens or issues associated with the inflow control devices. The service provider, Baker Hughes, elected to provide an expert view on this. 
</p>



      
<p>
A multi-disciplinary team was formed, comprising specialists in drilling fluids, production technology, reservoir engineering and production chemistry. The team performed a review and detailed analysis of the well drilling, completion and clean-up procedures. This was revealing and uncovered a number of factors which were most likely contributing to the reduced well productivity.
</p>



      
<p>
The presentation will describe the workflow conducted to investigate the well production issues and insights gained. This will demonstrate the value of an integrated approach together with the key results and conclusions.

<p>
Colin studied mechanical and petroleum reservoir engineering in the UK many years ago, after which he initially taught science to High School pupils in Papua New Guinea with Voluntary Service Overseas and then spent a year travelling back overland. He was fortunate to still find employment as a reservoir engineer on his return and since then has enjoyed a varied career working for many of the majors, one or two intermediates, the UK regulator and now Baker Hughes. During that time he has variously worked as reservoir engineer, production engineer and petrophysicist.

<p>
Colin is currently Principal Reservoir Engineer in Baker Hughesâ€™ Geoscience & Petroleum Engineering group of well and sub-surface specialists, with a particular focus on well inflow control. He is based in Aberdeen but spends a significant proportion of his time in Norway.
