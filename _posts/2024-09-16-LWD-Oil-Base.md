The presentation **“Logging-While-Drilling Oil Base Mud Electrical Imager Using Advanced Radar Technology”** will be given by **Inge Bye**, from **WELL ID**.

## Abstract
A LWD sensor is introduced for measuring a high-resolution borehole image in large boreholes and both in light and heavy oil based mud. The sensor uses advanced radar technology to deliver an electrical image to help geoscientists visualize and understand the stratigraphy and fractures. A pulse radar operating in the multi-gigahertz range is implemented within the Bottom-Hole-Assembly, and as the BHA rotates, the radar measurements scan the borehole surface, where time-of-flight is converted to a distance to the borehole wall (Caliper), and where the amplitude of the reflected signal correlates with the micro-resistivity/permittivity of the formation in the immediate vicinity of the borehole. Up until recently, sensors capable of performing these borehole imaging measurements while drilling, have been limited to smaller size boreholes. This new technology extends the application from traditional reservoir hole sizes up to 17-1/2” in Oil Base Mud.
 
## Biography
**Inge Bye**, Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the University of Stavanger, 2003. He has worked 19 years in the oil industry in the MWD/LWD domain, both in operations and research & development. He currently works as Business Development Manager in WELL ID. His interests include borehole imaging, drilling dynamics, and the use of high frequency sampling of downhole measurements to increase subsurface understanding and optimize drilling efficiency.
