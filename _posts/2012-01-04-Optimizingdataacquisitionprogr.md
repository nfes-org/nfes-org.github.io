Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Dynamic temperature simulations is a very useful tool to optimize the data acquisition program when the static temperature is beyond the equipment specification. Sensitivity analysis on drilling parameters and circulation rates show  often significant impact on well cooling.
