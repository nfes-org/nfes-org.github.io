Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Modern acoustics tools acquire a wealth of waveform data, which is often analysed for one specific purpose (i.e. pore pressure prediction, porosity, or seismic correlation) and then banished to the archives, bypassing many of the rich applications that can be achieved from further interpreting the data. Examples include fracture characterisation, permeability, wellbore stability, mud alteration effects, drilling-induced damage characterisation, secondary porosity, facies determination, hole size, cement bond quality, geosteering and production optimisation in conventional and unconventional reservoirs.  This presentation will review the myriad uses of sonic data as well as recommend which tools are suitable to each application and optimal configurations to get the best quality of data.  Also included will be specific considerations of which types of tool and applications are suitable for various environments such as deepwater, unconventional reservoirs, HPHT, and cased hole.
