<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Hydrocarbon saturations are key to reserves estimates. While various methods can be used to estimate fluid saturations, resistivity based saturation is used overwhelmingly in the industry. While it has its advantages, resistivity also comes with its limitations. Whether it is low contrast between water and hydrocarbon bearing rock, or uncertainty in the saturation equation parameters, relying solely on resistivity can be dangerous. Pay zones can be wrongly categorized as non-commercial or even missed altogether. What could have been bypassed based on resistivity alone, can be turned into prospective pay with newer logging techniques using Dielectrics, NMR and Spectroscopy.
