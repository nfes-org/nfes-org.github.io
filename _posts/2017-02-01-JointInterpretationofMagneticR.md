        The accurate quantification of fluid volumes is one of

        the most important tasks for determining the economic

        value of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Resistivity-based fluid

        saturation calculations have been established for many

        decades with known benefits and challenges. More

        recently nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

        technology has developed as an alternative, robust

        method for direct fluid volume estimation. Resistivity

        logging data are used to calculate saturation of

        conductive (e.g. water) versus non-conductive (e.g.

        hydrocarbon) fluids in the formation. NMR logging

        data capture information about pore size in the

        formation and, thus, separate movable fluids, usually

        residing in large pores, from bound fluids. The bound

        fluids are further sub-divided into clay-bound water

        components and irreducible components held by

        capillary forces. The movable water and hydrocarbon

        volumes can be estimated using simple T2 cutoff

        approaches or more sophisticated 2D-NMR methods

        (the latter of which are generally only available for

        wireline NMR applications).

        As today’s reservoirs are becoming more challenging,

        conventional resistivity data evaluation involves

        increasing difficulties and ambiguities such as in

        complex lithology due to the presence of conductive

        minerals, low formation water salinity, fractures and

        vugs, or local variations in water resistivity. NMR data

        processing and interpretation are also not straight

        forward in complex carbonates and heavy oil reservoirs,

        as well as in case of wettability alteration and due to the

        presence of magnetic minerals. Ambiguities in either of

        the measurements can be efficaciously addressed by

        combining results from both approaches. In simple

        reservoirs, for instance, the combination of resistivty

        and NMR reduces uncertainties and can be used to

        identify and quantify effects such as invasion or water

        (-free) production.

        We present a systematic compilation and discussion of

        main properties affecting resistivity and NMR fluid

        volume estimations such as Archie exponents and T2

        cutoffs. This includes various reservoir types with

        various fluid types and measurement conditions.

        Guidelines will be provided on how to combine

        resistivity-based fluid volumetrics and NMR-based

        volumetrics most effectively. An unpublished and four

        previously published log examples illustrate a wide

        range of reservoir scenarios. In addition to the log

        interpretation aspect, we also relate the results to their

        applications ranging from real-time drilling

        optimization through hydrocarbon-in-place estimates

        and reservoir modeling input to production and

        completion decisions.

        Geoffrey Page studied physics at

        the Royal College of Science in

        London. He began his oilfield

        career as a Dresser Atlas field

        engineer 36 years ago, moved into

        Petrophysics in Aberdeen 28 years

        ago, and is now Region

        Petrophysical Advisor for Baker

        Hughes based in Aberdeen. He is a former President of

        the Aberdeen chapter of the SPWLA (AFES) and was

        honoured with a life membership. He has written and

        presented many papers over the years, helped organise

        many of the conferences including SPWLA 2008 in

        Edinburgh, and in his spare time teaches the

        Petrophysics course of Aberdeen University’s

        "Integrated Petroleum Geoscience" MSc course.
