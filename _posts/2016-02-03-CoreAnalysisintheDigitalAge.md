<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



      
<p>
<em>
“Core samples truly represent the ground truth in the search for oil and gas. There are other established

sets of integrated parameters such as fluid properties, well data, etc…, but unlocking the secrets of the

rock will enable the operator understand the production potential of a reservoir and map out the best

well construction scenarios for optimal field production.”

<p>


Are these only nice words from a core analysis marketing brochure or can we really get more from the

core? Since coring operations and core analysis is expensive and time consuming how can we justify

investing in a full core analysis program and maximise the value of core analysis data. Why it is so

important to define targets and deliverables for a successful core analysis program?
</p>

<p>


This NFES lecture will be focused on the recent developments in core analysis, the eternal quest for

quality data to accurately define reservoir estimates and improve reservoir modelling.
</p>

<p>


We will also try to address the more recent and interesting developments in the core analysis field.

Digital rock properties and pore network modelling friend or foe?
