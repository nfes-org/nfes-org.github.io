Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
Conventional schemes used to classify carbonate reservoirs are often at a too finer scale and/or carry environmental uncertainly through to the static and dynamic reservoir models.  Industry descriptive Lithofacies schemes are typically based on the Dunham classification system (eg. skeletal packstone) and capture the finest scale depositional heterogeneity and are commonly developed at a scale below the resolution required for the geomodeller.  In addition, as carbonate pore systems are typically heterogeneous due to a variable diagenetic overprint then individual lithofacies have a wide range of reservoir properties.   Lithofacies Associations  upscale Lithofacies in to interpretative environmental groupings (eg. back shoal) that inherently, by their nature, carry uncertainly in their designation and distribution.  The concept of depositional packages is in development and aims to mitigate some of these issues by providing additional classification criteria that have greater applicability for both geomodelling and petrophysical integration.

Quintin is currently the Global Product Champion for the Integrated Reservoir Description Team at Senergy UK, based in Banchory, Aberdeenshire.  He has 13 years industry experience and prior to joining Senergy he was the Head of Carbonate Geology at Badley Ashton and Associates.   With a focus on carbonates, most of his experience has been gained from the evaluation of reservoirs from the Middle East, North Africa and offshore pre-salt of Brazil, through core description, facies analysis, sequence stratigraphic modelling, BHI evaluations and pore-scale analysis.  He  graduated in geology from Leicester University in 1996 and when on to do an M.Sc in sedimentology at Reading University in 1997, followed by a Ph.D. on Miocene deep water carbonates in Cyprus, finishing in 2001.
