<h4>
Abstract
</h4>





<p>
Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  measurements  have  been  used  as  a  way  to  evaluate reservoir  rocks  based,  on  the  longitudinal  and transverse relaxation times, T1 and T2, and the time dependent  diffusion  coefficient,  D(t).   Relaxation time  distributions can be related to pore  sizes and to the  free and  bound fluid fractions. In addition, there  are  well  established  equations  correlating relaxation  times  to  permeability.  Regarding diffusion, at short times  D(t)  is linked to the pore volume to surface area ratio while at long times it is  related  to  pore  tortuosity.  Diffusive  coupling between  pores  complicates  the  interpretation  of NMR  measurements  because  the  relaxation  time distribution  will  no  longer  be  an  accurate representation of the pore size distribution .  On the other  hand,  analyzing  the  effects  of  diffusive coupling  can  provide  information  about connectivity  within  the  pore space.   In  particular, knowing  whether  the  macro-pores  are  connected to  each  other  or  are  connected  only  through  the micro-pores  would  provide  valuable  insight regarding the permeability.
