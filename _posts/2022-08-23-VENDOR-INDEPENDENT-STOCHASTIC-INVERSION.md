## Abstract:

Geosteering has become an integral service while drilling horizontal sections and allows operators to maximize the footage drilled in the target reservoir. Proactive geosteering is an effective method of placing the wellbore at desired intervals and proactively responding to prevent exit from these zones. Deep and Ultra Deep Resistivity LWD tools are commonly applied to achieve this aim. Modern azimuthal resistivity tools represent top-tier technological equipment that provide an abundance of multi-spacing, multi-frequency, and multi-component resistivity data and have a complex configuration. Inversion of the tool’s response is the common method to interpret azimuthal resistivity data. To process different kinds of azimuthal resistivity data on the operator side, ROGII has developed the unified vendor-independent algorithm for inversion calculation and consequently the software module. This presentation will be focused on the implementation of this algorithm on the resistivity responses from different azimuthal resistivity tools in various geological formations from all around the world.
