The presentation, **”Experience with CICM (Casing Integrity and Cement Mapping)  on NCS;  Drill pipe conveyed ultra sonic cased hole logging”** will be given by **Øystein Meling, from Baker Hughes**.
 
## Abstract:

The presentation is about CICM, which the world’s first ultra-sonic sonic drill pipe conveyed logging tool. The technology offers cost savings in terms of rig time and POB compared to WL deployed logging tools, as it can be piggybacked on most planned drill pipe runs, often at IO level 3.  The presentation covers technical features, applications, lessons learned and case studies after 18 months of operations on the NCS.
