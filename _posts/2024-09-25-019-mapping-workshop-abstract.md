## Abstract
This presentation highlights how the integration of multidimensional UDAR data with other LWD technologies, especially high-resolution resistivity images, contributes to a holistic understanding of a reservoir with a long production history. Accurate mapping of water coning and water finger profiles using UDAR can easily be linked to historical production from older plugged and abandoned (P&A) wells. Digital deliverables from UDAR have helped to redefine production strategy and revise production estimates by updating existing geological models based on UDAR data. 



Challenges and Solutions in a Mature Oil Field - YME 

The YME field, located in the southeastern part of the North Sea, has an extensive production history since 1996. After almost 20 years of pause, the field has now been redeveloped with use of latest Ultra Deep Azimuthal Resistivity (UDAR) technology to improve horizontal well placement and reservoir understanding. The main challenge is to predict how fluids have redistributed over the past two decades without 4D seismic data.

The days of easy drilling to produce oil from large reservoirs are over. Operators now face challenges in mature brown fields with unevenly distributed production water. Traditional development techniques based on static geological models are insufficient for commercial development and there is a need for multidimensional reservoir mapping during drilling to achieve production goals by better understanding reservoir fluid dynamics.



UDAR Technology

To address these uncertainties, multidimensional UDAR reservoir mapping was used, converting ultra-deep electromagnetic measurements into a volumetric distribution of resistivity around the borehole. 

With the main goals being:

•	Geo-steering to maximize exposure to good reservoirs sands.

•	Map reservoir heterogeneity for better understanding of production effects from older wells.

•	If possible, identify new missed HC targets near wellbore



The current UDAR technology collects a comprehensive set of measurements known as 360° electromagnetic tensors, transmitted in real-time using a new data compression algorithm. These measurements are converted into 3D resistivity volumes, which can be used with standard interpretation tools in real-time. This provides seamless integration of real-time information with existing geological models, aiding informed geo-steering decisions and enhancing reservoir understanding.
