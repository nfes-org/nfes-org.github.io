The presentation **"Seismic LWD: Real-time lookahead VSP while drilling"** will be given by **Neil R. Kelsall, from SLB**.

 

## Abstract 

Seismic While Drilling with LWD technology has now been in commercial use globally for 20 years! Over this time there have been many lessons learnt in how to acquire data, that requires low acoustic noise levels, during a drilling operation. This talk describes how seismic LWD works and the challenges faced for different applications and explains how they have been overcome to provide a reliable and efficient Real-Time look-ahead while drilling technique.
