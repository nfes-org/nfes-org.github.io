## Abstract
Mapping heavy oil or tar presents challenges with conventional geosteering methods, limiting options for safe well placement. In this study, we address the optimization of a horizontal injector placement in a thin water leg laying between oil above it and heavy oil and tar below, acting as permeability barriers affecting injectivity index.



An integrated petrophysical geosteering approach was employed using real-time Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) logging, Formation Pressure Testing, and Extra Deep Azimuthal Resistivity (EDAR) for well placement. These tools were leveraged to determine fluid viscosity, integrated with EDAR inversions, we gained insights into apparent formation dip, individual layer resistivity, and zone thickness, facilitating tar spot mapping and avoidance.



Through the integration of real-time data processing and EDAR inversions, the well was successfully placed in the target thin water leg, optimizing net-to-gross while adhering to maximum allowable dog leg severity (DLS) constraints. LWD NMR aided in positioning the well within the highest macro porosity position within the layer, while injectivity index calculations from real-time NMR data and formation pressure testing were validated through post-drilling injectivity tests and production logging tools.



This combined approach offers novel solutions for improved well placement, enhanced injectivity index, and overall field development and productivity enhancement.
