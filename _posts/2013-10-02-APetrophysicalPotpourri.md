<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



		

		
<p>
The plan is to cover three subjects:
</p>



        
<ul>


<li>
Using Quadrant or Image Derived Resistivity and Density to enhance evaluation in high deviation wells.
</li>





<li>
Kv/kh from core and issues around this
</li>





<li>
Determination of incidence angle by comparison of total GR from LWD with modeled GR response. (Method for determining landing angle during drilling of well using total GR only to determine the angle between borehole and formation)
</li>



</ul>



<p>
The subjects are really quite basic but hopefully they will trigger some ideas and discussion
</p>
