<h4>
Abstract
</h4>



 
<p>
Some key applications of distributed acoustic fiber optics measurements will be discussed, with the measurements performed during logging or using existing permanent fibers.
</p>

<p>


In particular, the importance of the borehole measurements in the calibration of anisotropic velocity models will be highlighted.

The talk will provide examples and cover technical aspects of the integration of advanced sonic measurements with borehole seismic and surface seismic data.
</p>

<p>


The end goal is to obtain accurate velocity models for seismic imaging and for geomechanical studies.

<p>
Rafael Guerra is a petroleum geophysicist, graduated from the French Petroleum Institute (IFP), having evolved essentially within the Schlumberger group, with further experience acquired with two other Oil&Gas consulting companies. Expert in borehole seismic and acoustic techniques, he has gained over the last 20 years extensive operational experience internationally in data acquisition, processing and interpretation. This included also the interpretation of surface seismic data in exploration and field development projects.
