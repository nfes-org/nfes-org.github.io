            The Norwegian Formation Evaluation Society (NFES) is your local Norwegian chapter
            of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spwla.org/">SPWLA (Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts)</a>. The purpose of
            the society is to contribute to the development of the science of Formation Evaluation
            in Norway. This is mainly achieved through the arrangement of monthly technical
            meetings (including lunch) and organising seminars on selected subjects. These arrangements
            give you an opportunity to meet with colleagues from oil and service companies,
            universities and research institutes to discuss matters of common interest. In addition,
            the NFES Fund finances research projects, supports publications and awards members
            who publish papers or make particularly strong contributions to the development
            of Formation Evaluation. 
            So, if you want to take part in all this,

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Norwegian Formation Evaluation Society (NFES) was founded on March 23, 1981, with the primary goal of sharing knowledge about formation evaluation to support oil and gas operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Simultaneously, NFES aimed to connect with the global Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA) to facilitate knowledge sharing beyond borders and take an active role in global events.
